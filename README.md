# FlixBus-Scraper
Tool to help those in Ukraine find alternate escape routes. Made for my friend Vic who is currently there.

# Usage
Use the script as follows: 
```plaintext
python3 main.py [-h] [-c Country] [--file File] depart_city date

Searches for available FlixBus routes from one city, to all cities in specified country(s)

Positional arguments:
  depart_city  The city where you would like to depart from (e.g. Lviv)
  date         The date you wish to depart in the format (dd.mm.yyyy) e.g. (25.01.2022)

optional arguments:
  -h --help    show this help message and exit
  -c Country   Country(s) you would like to search for routes for. (e.g. Poland) (e.g. Hungary,Romania,Slovakia)
  --file File  Path to file containing list of countries you would like to search for routes for
```

Try and stay west if possible, as these areas are currently considered much safer than the north, east or south!

Good luck! ❤️
